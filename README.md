# Hex-MCTS-RL-DL
This Git repository contains the code for an AI agent that plays the board game Hex using a combination of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Learning (DL).

Hex-MCTS-RL-DL
This project aims to implement an MCTS system and combine it with Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Learning (DL) to play Hex, a board game with simple rules but myriad possible board configurations.

File Structure
game/ - Contains code for the Hex game manager, including the rules and logic for the game.
mcts/ - Contains code for the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm, including tree search, node expansion, leaf evaluation, and backpropagation.
rl/ - Contains code for the Reinforcement Learning aspect of the project, including the implementation of the value function and/or policy.
dl/ - Contains code for the Deep Learning aspect of the project, including the implementation of neural networks for the value function and/or policy.
main.py - The entry point of the program, where the game, MCTS, RL, and DL components are all brought together to play Hex.
